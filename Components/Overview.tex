\section*{Overview}
I am a highly-motivated software engineer and researcher. I enjoy intellectually challenging work, solving complex technical problems using my experience in both research and software engineering.\\[5pt]

I have a wide experience of technologies and am quick and eager to learn anything new. I'm looking for a position that will allow me to explore novel solutions to problems, both hardware and software.\\[5pt]

In my current position, I am driving the team to write more secure and more maintanable code through discussion of best practices and designing and implementing improvements for the existing codebase. I recently took part in a firm-wide security competition where I was ranked 2nd worldwide for secure Python Django development.\\[5pt]

I enjoy programming and solving problems, both in the office and in my free time. Some of my personal projects are available at \url{https://github.com/timlardner}.
