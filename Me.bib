	abstract = {Full matrix capture (FMC) ultrasound can be used to generate a permanent re-focusable record of data describing the geometry of a part; a valuable asset for an inspection process. FMC is a desirable acquisition mode for automated scanning of complex geometries, as it allows compensation for surface shape in post processing and application of the total focusing method. However, automating the delivery of such FMC inspection remains a significant challenge for real industrial processes due to the high data overhead associated with the ultrasonic acquisition. The benefits of NDE delivery using six-axis industrial robots are well versed when considering complex inspection geometries, but such an approach brings additional challenges to scanning speed and positional accuracy when combined with FMC inspection. This study outlines steps taken to optimize the scanning speed and data management of a process to scan the diffusion bonded membrane of a titanium test plate. A system combining a KUKA robotic arm and a reconfigurable FMC phased array controller is presented. The speed and data implications of different scanning methods are compared, and the impacts on data visualization quality are discussed with reference to this study. For the 0.5 m2 sample considered, typical acquisitions of 18 TB/m2 were measured for a triple back wall FMC acquisition, illustrating the challenge of combining high data throughput with acceptable scanning speeds.},

	abstract = {Materials with a coarse grain structure are becoming increasingly prevalent in industry due to their resilience to stress and corrosion. These materials are difficult to inspect with ultrasound because reflections from the grains lead to high noise levels which hinder the echoes of interest. Spatially Averaged Sub-Aperture Correlation Imaging (SASACI) is an advanced array beamforming technique that uses the cross-correlation between images from array sub-apertures to generate an image weighting matrix, in order to reduce noise levels. This paper presents a method inspired by SASACI to further improve imaging using phase information to refine focusing and reduce noise. A-scans from adjacent array elements are cross-correlated using both signal amplitude and phase to refine delay laws and minimize phase aberration. The phase-based and amplitude-based corrected images are used as inputs to a two-dimensional cross-correlation algorithm that will output a weighting matrix that can be applied to any conventional image. This approach was validated experimentally using a 5MHz array a coarse grained Inconel 625 step wedge, and compared to the Total Focusing Method (TFM). Initial results have seen SNR improvements of over 20dB compared to TFM, and a resolution that is much higher.},

	abstract = {A simulation suite, cueMAP, has been developed to facilitate the design of inspection processes and sparse 2D array configurations. At the core of cueMAP is a Total Focusing Method (TFM) imaging algorithm that enables computer assisted design of ultrasonic inspection scenarios, including the design of bespoke array configurations to match the inspection criteria. This in-house developed TFM code allows for interactive evaluation of image quality indicators of ultrasonic imaging performance when utilizing a 2D phased array working in FMC/TFM mode. The cueMAP software uses a series of TFM images to build a map of resolution, contrast and sensitivity of imaging performance of a simulated reflector, swept across the inspection volume. The software takes into account probe properties, wedge or water standoff, and effects of specimen curvature. In the validation process of this new software package, two 2D arrays have been evaluated on 304n stainless steel samples, typical of the primary circuit in nuclear plants. Thick section samples have been inspected using a 1MHz 2D matrix array. Due to the processing efficiency of the software, the data collected from these array configurations has been used to investigate the influence sub-aperture operation on inspection performance.},

	title = {Robust defect detection in ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation ({NDE}) of difficult materials},
	doi = {10.1109/ULTSYM.2012.0116},
	abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel and flexible method for reliable and robust defect detection in difficult materials. It is well known in the literature that the interaction between ultrasonic beams and the insonified medium is a highly nonlinear process, which potentially exhibits distinctive frequency-dependent properties for defects and random reflectors with a degree of randomness. Instead of investigating the structure and pattern of the spectrum of an individual echo, the proposed method focuses on the distinction between the ensembles of defect signals and clutter noise. A training process is used to establish the statistical analysis, based on which a hypothesis test is then applied to received echoes to detect defects. The approach is expected to be adaptive to the material microstructure and characteristics due to the statistical training. Experiments with a 5MHz transducer on austenitic steel samples from a coal fired power station are conducted. Austenitic steel is highly scattering and attenuating, and the method demonstrates accurate and reliable defect detection. When applied to A-scan waveforms, the grain noise is significantly reduced while defect signals are enhanced, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is improved by about 20dB. As a result, the defect is more visible and can be readily identified in B-scan images. Initial results indicate that this method is robust and delivers good performance without additional calibration and compensation.},
