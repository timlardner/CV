	abstract = {Pressure tubes are critical components of CANDU reactors and other pressurized heavy water–type reactors because they contain the nuclear fuel and the coolant. Manufacturing flaws as well as defects developed during in-service operation can lead to coolant leakage and can potentially damage the reactor. The current inspection process of these flaws is based on manually analyzing ultrasonic data received from multiple probes during planned, statutory outages. Recent advances in ultrasonic inspection tools enable the provision of high-resolution data of significantly large volumes. This highlights the need for an efficient autonomous signal analysis process. Typically, automation of ultrasonic inspection data analysis is approached by knowledge-based or supervised data-driven methods. This work proposes an unsupervised data-driven framework that requires no explicit rules or individually labeled signals. The framework follows a two-stage clustering procedure that utilizes the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise density-based clustering algorithm and aims to provide decision support for the assessment of potential defects in a robust and consistent way. Nevertheless, verified defect dimensions are essential in order to assess the results and train the framework for unseen defects. Initial results of the implementation are presented and discussed, with the method showing promise as a means of assessing ultrasonic inspection data.},

	abstract = {Pressure tubes within CANDU reactors are subject to frequent ultrasonic non-destructive examination to identify and characterize any defects that pose a risk of initiating Delayed Hydride Cracking (DHC), a well-known problem that occurs in zirconium components that are subject to high mechanical and thermal stresses. The analysis of the ultrasonic data gathered from the pressure tubes is often a long and repetitive process on the critical path to the restart of the reactor. Motivations for developing an automated system include saving time on the critical path, minimising human subjectivity from the process and increasing repeatability of measurements. An automated system providing decision support to analysts also reduces the risk of operator fatigue by minimising time spent processing routine defects. This paper describes a novel system for the automated analysis of CANDU pressure tube inspection data. The system automates the entire initial examination process including the complex decision-making procedures by implementing an expert system with an associated rule-base. Results from this system are detailed, illustrating the location and characterisation of defects and key features within the pressure tube with a high degree of accuracy while increasing repeatability through the removal of subjectivity in measurements.},

	url = {https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/60540/},
	abstract = {Delayed Hydride Cracking (DHC) is a crack growth mechanism that occurs in zirconium alloys, including the pressure tubes of CANDU reactors. DHC is caused by hydrogen in solution in zirconium components being diffused to any flaws present, resulting in an increased concentration of hydrogen within these flaws. An increased hydrogen concentration can lead to brittleness, followed by cracking, in high-stress regions of a pressure tube. Regular in-service ultrasonic inspection of CANDU pressure tubes aim to locate and classify any flaws that pose a potential for DHC initiation. A common approach to inspection is the use of a bespoke tool containing multiple ultrasonic transducers to ensure that each point on the pressure tube is inspected from a minimum of three angles during a scan. All flaws from within the inspected pressure tubes must be characterized prior to restarting the reactor, thus the time-consuming analysis process lies on the critical outage path. This process is manually intensive and often requires a significant amount of expert knowledge. A modular system to automatically process outage data to provide decision support to analysts has been developed. This system saves time on the critical outage path while providing repeatable and explicable measurements. Part of the analysis process requires the depth of all flaws to be measured, which is often the most time consuming stage of the analysis process. This paper describes an approach that utilizes captured analysts knowledge to perform automatic flaw depth estimation.},

This paper presents recent outcomes of work aimed at removing the bottleneck due to data acquisition rates, to fully exploit the scanning speed of modern 6-DoF manipulators. State of the art ultrasonic instrumentation has been integrated into a large robot cell to enable fast data acquisition, high scan resolutions and accurate positional encoding. A fibre optic connection between the ultrasonic instrument and the server computer enables data transfer rates up to 1.6GB/s. Multiple data collection methods are compared. Performance of the integrated system allows traditional ultrasonic phased array scanning as well as full matrix capture (FMC). In FMC configuration, linear scan speeds up to 156mm/s with 64 pulses per frame are achieved - this speed is only constrained by the acoustic wave propagation in the component. An 8x increase of the speed (up to 1.25m/s) can be achieved using multiple transmission elements, reaching the physical limits for acceptable acoustic alignment of transmission and reception paths. Scan results, relative to a 1.2m × 3m carbon fibre sample, are presented.},

	abstract = {Pressure tube inspection within CANDU nuclear reactors is a critical maintenance operation to identify and track the growth of defects within the tube. Current inspection approaches utilising ultrasonic techniques are technically challenging, which cause the whole inspection process to be resource intensive and expensive to implement. This paper will describe the initial stages in the development of a simulation approach for the ultrasonic inspection methodology to research advanced solutions with the objective of improving the inspection accuracy. Zirconium tubes with a thickness of 4.3mm and a required measurement accuracy of defect depth of 0.1mm require the use of high frequency ultrasonic transducers. The finite element modelling of high frequencies is challenging due to the increased mesh requirements to resolve the small wavelengths and the large propagation distance which can cause numerical dispersion. Hence, a 2D finite element hybrid model is developed in PZFlex software to overcome this difficulty with five subsequent components containing both finite element models and analytical solutions: ultrasound transmission; transmission extrapolation (wave propagation); target interaction; echo wave extrapolation and ultrasonic reception. To test the capability of defect inspection using the hybrid model, a slot with a depth of 1mm is introduced in the model. The depth information was calculated from the time-of-flight between the reflections of the tube surface and the slot. The predicted modelled depth estimates produces errors of less than 20micron for both 10MHz and 20MHz probe configurations validating the hybrid modelling approach. Moreover, experimental validation of the hybrid modelling approach is demonstrated.},

	abstract = {The push for more efficient operation of power generation stations has led to the development of advanced alloys designed to cope with the stresses of running at elevated temperatures. The micro-structure of these new alloys makes the inspection process difficult due to large grains that scatter ultrasonic energy. Aerospace components such as aircraft engine turbine blades are made from similar materials and pose the same difficulties for inspection. In addition, the complex geometries of many of these parts hinder the use of existing advanced imaging methodologies. The current inspection process involves using both individual transducers and phased arrays to collect pulse-echo data from structures. This process is not sufficient for such difficult materials and a new process must be devised, tested and deployed. This thesis presents an investigation of new practical techniques to process ultrasonic array data collected via a Full Matrix Capture. Two novel signal processing techniques are presented, evaluated and compared to the Total Focusing Method, which is currently considered as the gold standard in ultrasonic array processing. A study into efficient imaging has also been completed, which involved development of an algorithm to focus upon any point through an arbitrary refracting interface. This algorithm was implemented on a commercially available graphics card and is able to account for a curved interface in real time with no prior knowledge of the surface profile. Spatially Averaged Sub-Aperture Correlation Imaging splits the full matrix of data into a set of sub-apertures which are imaged independently from each other. These images are then combined into two sets and are input to a two-dimensional cross-correlation algorithm that outputs a weighting matrix that can be applied to the sum of all images. Signals that are from legitimate reectors are highly correlated while less-correlated indications are the result of noise from scattering and multi-path propagation. SASACI has been shown to perform well experimentally through inspection of defects within multiple highly scattering welds at a frequency of 5 MHz. Correlation for Adaptively Focused Imaging aims to correct for anisotropy within difficult materials. The longitudinal velocity within a difficult material can vary with position and using an average velocity does not guarantee a well-focused image. For each pixel in an image,CAFI calculates which samples will be used to calculate the amplitude of the pixel before cross-correlating the signals from adjacent array elements and shifting the delay to the point of maximum focus. This methodology is effective when a small area with a known reflector is being imaged, and for this reason the algorithm is suited to characterisation of reflectors. This technique was experimentally validated on a block of Inconel 625 with a number of side-drilled holes.},

The inspection surface of such components is often complex and non-planar, resulting in coupling issues for a conventional probe, with a fixed footprint. In general this instigates complex and lengthy data analysis to retrieve meaningful results. An efficient solution for inspecting such components is sought by using 2D arrays, collecting FMC and using TFM to construct the surface profile, which is then extracted and subsequently used to compose a TFM image of the component. The solution has been developed within the software platform cueART, designed to operate on GP-GPU processors, in a move towards real time imaging. The method has been used to inspect a 304n section of stainless steel with a surface representing the worst acceptable error of form expected in a practical inspection scenario. The results show the full surface of the test block can be reconstructed, as well as a range of artificial defects being accurately identified.},

	copyright = {All rights reserved},
	url = {https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/58349/},
	abstract = {Coarse-grained engineering materials exhibiting heterogeneous and anisotropic microstructure are used extensively in many industrial sectors. Inspecting such materials using ultrasound suffers from backscattered signals from grain boundaries resulting in strong speckle noise, which reduces image contrast and increases difficulty in image interpretation. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to adaptively compound images which are acquired in different frequency channels (FC), in order to remove or minimize speckle. Most existing image compounding algorithms are point-wise and based on order statistics estimation, which implicitly assume speckle is spatially and spectrally uncorrelated, leading to limited success in speckle suppression. The proposed method applies spatially variant weightings which are calculated to account for both spatial correlation and inter-FC correlation of speckle noise and flaw echo signals. To validate this method, experiments on two highly scattering samples were conducted: an Inconel 625 block with two side-drilled holes and a steel weld block with an implanted tilted flaw, simulating lack of fusion. Speckle point was found to be less spatially and spectrally correlated than flaw echo, yielding smaller compounding output. By applying adaptive compounding algorithms, flaw-to-noise ratio (FNR) of the Inconel block has achieved a {\textasciitilde}45 dB enhancement compared with minimization compounding, whilst {\textasciitilde}60dB FNR improvement for the steel weld block is demonstrated. It is concluded that the proposed algorithm can significantly suppresses speckle and enhance flaw characterization without spatial resolution loss.},

	doi = {10.1109/ULTSYM.2012.0116},
	abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel and flexible method for reliable and robust defect detection in difficult materials. It is well known in the literature that the interaction between ultrasonic beams and the insonified medium is a highly nonlinear process, which potentially exhibits distinctive frequency-dependent properties for defects and random reflectors with a degree of randomness. Instead of investigating the structure and pattern of the spectrum of an individual echo, the proposed method focuses on the distinction between the ensembles of defect signals and clutter noise. A training process is used to establish the statistical analysis, based on which a hypothesis test is then applied to received echoes to detect defects. The approach is expected to be adaptive to the material microstructure and characteristics due to the statistical training. Experiments with a 5MHz transducer on austenitic steel samples from a coal fired power station are conducted. Austenitic steel is highly scattering and attenuating, and the method demonstrates accurate and reliable defect detection. When applied to A-scan waveforms, the grain noise is significantly reduced while defect signals are enhanced, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is improved by about 20dB. As a result, the defect is more visible and can be readily identified in B-scan images. Initial results indicate that this method is robust and delivers good performance without additional calibration and compensation.},
